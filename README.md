Create the Card UI from JSON data and store All Controls and Scripts as JSON

This stack will create the main card user interface from JSON data that is stored on card 2 of the stack.

The 'Display All CardObjects' runs a script that will create JSON data of all the controls on the card as well as their scripts in the field below the button.

A future idea is to generate the JSON data on every save and send it to Github for version control. It's a way to have both your scripts and controls under Github source control without using any binary stack files.
